# AlgorithmsInPythonExercises
Code for the exercises in the Goodrich Data Structures and Algorithms in Python textbook.

As part of teaching myself Python and also in order to review the concepts I learned in my Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms course, I am working through many of the exercises in this textbook.

I am organizing my code into files based on the book chapters.
